1. To produce a random X% subset of lines within the amazon dataset, I used six variables within my script (see below and in the repo):
	a. index was used to track the current index of the while loop
	b. total was used to track the total number of lines within the input file
	c. readTotal was used to multiply the inputted percentage to the total. 
	d. finalrange divides readTotal by 100, since the input is a percentage and needs to be divided by 100 to represent the total lines to be randomly 	   printed out.
	e. lineval was used within the while loop to produce a random line number within the range of file
	f. textLine was used to retrieve the nth line using sed, which was produced by the random line generator 

	Note that in each iteration of the while loop, the value of lineval produces a new random number.
	The while loop continues till the index is equal to finalval, which contains the total lines to iterate through based upon input percentage.
	See 2. for output.

if [[ $# -lt 2 ]] ; then
	return 1
fi

index=1
total=$(wc $2 | awk '{print $1}')
readTotal=$(($total * $1))
finalrange=$(( readTotal / 100 ))


while [ $index -le $finalrange ]
	do
		lineval=$(($RANDOM % ($total - 1) + 1))
		textLine=$(sed "${lineval}q;d" $2)
		echo $textLine
		index=$((index + 1))
	done

2. Below, I ran the script on 10% of a shortened amazon reviews file containing only the first 100 reviews called shortened_rev_amazon.tsv. 
It returned a random list of 10 reviews within the subset using randomly generated line numbers within the while loop to extract lines in a random manner.

If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment. 2005-10-14

US 12071875 R12CUIV8LIFCYD 1904754724 456946589 The Zartarbia Tales: Bk.1: Isabella Zophie and Le Cirque De Magique Books 5 0 0 N N Zartarbia Book 1 - Excellent Isabella Zophie & Le Cirque de Magique is an excellent book. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read. <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus. Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica. The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia. Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques. <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny. The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book. <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone. <br /> 2005-10-14
US 50732546 R17026W0TBFZGL 045121692X 904844135 The Last Heiress (Friarsgate Inheritance, Book 4) Books 5 1 2 N N superb historical romance During the reign of Henry VIII, at fourteen Elizabeth Meredith inherited Friarsgate when her mother and older middle sister married and moved onto their respective spouses' estate and her oldest sibling and her husband chose the king's court. Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court. However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal. As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court. There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn. Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters. Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner 2005-10-14

US 27925116 R7M06Z88PD7SX 0029148510 72387289 Acts of War: Behavior of Men in Battle Books 4 14 14 N N Solid Book About Facing Death and Killing in War Whether intentional or not, this book's audience is the former or current military member. But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book. The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war. Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect. How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards. I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach. I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise. The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical. Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach. As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\" True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached. However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there. Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book. I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented. Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book. I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go. I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so. I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time. 2005-10-14

US 53000124 R1KJ6MB7MRSQFF 0805076069 145341889 Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream Books 4 9 11 N N I viewed this the opposite of Publisher's Weekly ... This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor. I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\" I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place. To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did. In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book. It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day. Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did. As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre. I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking. In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend. 2005-10-14
