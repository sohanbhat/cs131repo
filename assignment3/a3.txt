1. Created directed graph between id which was replied to in left column (replied to column) and id which replied in right column (author column). Then, I converted the file from tsv to csv with sed. See replies_cleaned.csv for final result.

]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv |  cut -f6,2 | awk '$1!=$2{print $2,$1}' > replies_cleaned.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed 's/ /,/g' replies_cleaned.tsv > replies_cleaned.csv

2. Created bins for users who received three or more replies and found counts for each bin. First, I filtered out users who replied to themselves and then sorted the "replied_to" column which the tweet wasreplying to. Then, using uniq -c, a total count of replies to each user was found. Then, I printed out the frequencies, sorted them, and found the counts for each frequency / bin. Lastly, I filtered out results to only contain frequency counts of three or more replies and converted the file to a csv using sed. See replies_bins_no_spaces.csv for result.

]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv |  cut -f6,2 | awk '$1!=$2{print $2}' | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '$2>=3{print $0}' > 
 reply_bins.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed  's/^ *//g' reply_bins.tsv > replies_bins_no_spaces.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed 's/ /,/g' replies_bins_no_spaces.tsv > replies_bins_no_spaces.csv

3. See RepliesReceivedHistogram.png for histogram for users Segmented by Total Replies Received (X) and total Number of Users in each Bin (Y). 

4. To find the most frequent hashtags in the largest cluster of users, I began by finding all the users ids' that had received three or more replies, to be used as a lookup value to extract hashtags from the larger dataset using grep -f (excluding bots by checking for reply and author column for matching values). Then, I cut the author column, hashtags column, replied_to column from the main dataset to use as the reference file for the lookup using grep -f. Lastly, the produced output was sorted for use in diff. I then reproduced the output for top 30 hashtags from question 5 of A2 and sorted its output for use in diff. Then, to find the differences between the two files, I used diff. I found that there were a total of 21 differences between the files and 9 total similarities. The different hashtags that appeared in the largest replies cluster are: alberta, armukrainenow, ausvotes, ausvotes2022, ba2, covidisnotover, insiders, kayburley, putinisawarcriminal, putinswar, russiagohome, russianarmy, russianukrainianwar, sarscov2, stopputin, stoprussia, terrorussia, ukraineunderattack, votingrightsact, –Ω–µ—Ç–≤–æ–π–Ω–µ, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–°–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏.
