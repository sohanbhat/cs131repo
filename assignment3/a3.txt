1. Created directed graph between id which was replied to in left column (replied to column) and id which replied in right column (author column). Then, I converted the file from tsv to csv with sed. See replies_cleaned.csv for final result.

]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv |  cut -f6,2 | awk '$1!=$2{print $2,$1}' > replies_cleaned.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed 's/ /,/g' replies_cleaned.tsv > replies_cleaned.csv

2. Created bins for users who received three or more replies and found counts for each bin. First, I filtered out users who replied to themselves and then sorted the "replied_to" column which the tweet wasreplying to. Then, using uniq -c, a total count of replies to each user was found. Then, I printed out the frequencies, sorted them, and found the counts for each frequency / bin. Lastly, I filtered out results to only contain frequency counts of three or more replies and converted the file to a csv using sed. See replies_bins_no_spaces.csv for result.

]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2.tsv |  cut -f6,2 | awk '$1!=$2{print $2}' | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c | awk '$2>=3{print $0}' > 
 reply_bins.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed  's/^ *//g' reply_bins.tsv > replies_bins_no_spaces.tsv
]0;sohan@sjsu:~/A2/A3[sohan@sjsu A3]$ sed 's/ /,/g' replies_bins_no_spaces.tsv > replies_bins_no_spaces.csv

4. To find the most frequent hashtags in the largest cluster of users, I began by finding all the users ids' that had received three or more replies, to be used as a lookup value to extract hashtags from the larger dataset using grep -f (excluding bots by checking for reply and author column for matching values). Then, I cut the author column, hashtags column, replied_to column from the main dataset to use as the reference file for the lookup using grep -f. Lastly, the produced output was sorted for use in diff. I then reproduced the output for top 30 hashtags from question 5 of A2 and sorted its output for use in diff. Then, to find the differences between the two files, I used diff. I found that there were a total of 21 differences between the files and 9 total similarities. The different hashtags that appeared in the largest replies cluster are: alberta, armukrainenow, ausvotes, ausvotes2022, ba2, covidisnotover, insiders, kayburley, putinisawarcriminal, putinswar, russiagohome, russianarmy, russianukrainianwar, sarscov2, stopputin, stoprussia, terrorussia, ukraineunderattack, votingrightsact, нетвойне, РоссияСмотри.
