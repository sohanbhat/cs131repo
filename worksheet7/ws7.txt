1. I began by cutting for the review body column and used sed to remove all commas, dots, and semicolons 
in the given file using sed with the expression option specified. Then, to remove the stop words (and, or, if, in, it) 
I used the second sed prompt which looks for the stop words themselves which will always be preceded with a space. 
That way, if the sequence of the stop word was found within another word, it wouldn't be selected. Lastly, to remove html tags, 
I used the last sed expression which finds all sequences that begin with "<" and end with ">", while accounting for any characters in between "<" and ">".

Temple to the wind is a riveting account of the Reliance story I would also putright up there with SeabiscuitIn the Heart of the Sea The book is expertly writtenextremely well researched I found the biographical material about Herreshoff BarrLipton very interesting I especially enjoyed the fast paced play by play action of the races between RelianceShamrock III I highly recommend Temple to the Wind
I'm a history buffhave not previously been a sailing buff -- BUT this book may make me one! If you're like me you will enjoy learning more about the time period the America's Cup races Sir Thomas Lipton Nathanael HerreshoffCharlie Barr  It's apparent that the author loves what he was researching/writing about becausemadea joy to read!
This book was an entertaininginformative even for someone who generally tries to avoid the non-fiction aisle The book is packed with informationis clearly well researched -- who knew the America's Cup played such a big partthe history of this country Book was recommended by sailor but being one is certainly not a prerequisite (as I am proof positive)  Read this bookyou will be recommendingto your friendsfamily
Temple to the Wind is the next creative non-fiction hit  As you can tell by the editorial reviews provided above Temple to the Wind is comparable to Seabiscuit Fastnet Force TenIn the Heart of the Sea  It really is that good  The story of Captain NatCharlie Barr has been told numerous timesbooks with an academicdry approach  I know because I've read most of them  Pastore breaks from that trendputs humor suspensein-depth research into a book that is obviously well researchedwritten  Pastore's lifetimethe maritime world combined with his academic approachfluent writing style give the reader a story that has been told multiple times but never quite like this  Temple to the Wind like Reliance is a winner     What I especially like about Temple to the Wind is its lack of \\"fluff\\" writing  Instead of using fabricated dialogue to embellishgive voice to the characters Pastore mined the available material (including personal lettersdiaries of Captain NatSir Lipton) at the New York Yacht Club Mystic SeaportRoyal Ulster Yacht Club to create the tensioninteraction between the characters  From my experience sailingracing on the restored J boats ShamrockEndeavourmy time spentthe yacht construction industry I can say that Pastore has hit the nail on the head whencomes to recreating the constructionracing of the great Reliance  His description of the construction techniques usedthe racing strategy are right on  Howeverneeds to be stressed that Temple to the Wind does not read like a boat building manualracing rules guide  It is firstforemost a story about the characters that surrounded the boat  For those of you who are unfamiliar with maritime terminology don't worry the extensive glossary provides accurateunderstandable definitionsexplanations  The glossary also contains a helpfuland accurate illustration    Experienced sailors armchair sailorshistory buffs alike this book is either a perfect way to pass the winter months that are approachingto enjoy while sitting at anchor next summer   
I picked up Temple to the Wind to attempt to understand my faters passion for the sea  I was intrigued by the storyperson Nathanael Herreshoffthe historical accuracy of the evolution of naval architecture    The book was so well written that I now am begining to understand ones passion for sailing    It is obvious Pastore feels the same way  I thinkorder to really convey an interesta subject you have to be committed  Pastore's committment is clear    Well Done!thanks for the lesson!   
I'm not much of a sailor but this book intrigued me because of its titlethe beautiful cover picture  I have fond memories of livingNewport Rhode Island during the excitement of America's Cup season  Well I couldn't put this book down!  Pastore has a real gift for writing  The story of Nathanael Herreshoff the early days of the America's Cup is so well researchedwritten that even a landlubber like me could stay riveted I was fascinated with the characters   If you are looking for a well written story I recommend Temple to the Wind I hope to read more from Christopher Pastore soon! 
I recently finished reading \\"A Temple to the Wind\\"I must say that I really enjoyed I'm no sailorhad no issue understanding any of the nomenclaturetactics described  If you do have a question there is a beautifully illustrated glossary to refer to  The story of Herreshoff itself is a compelling one  His influence extended beyond naval architecture into American culture by making the America's cup an excitingavidly followed event  One of the more compelling aspects was the intimate knowledge the author possessed about eventsindividuals that transpired over a hundred years ago -was like they were witnessed first hand  The book is written with great rhythmnever leaves the reader wishing for the next chapter I thoroughly enjoyed this book
I picked this book up a few days agoI finishedat warp speed    This is a book about the America's Cup races at the turn of the century between EnglishAmerican teams of boat designers sailorswealthy financial backers  The author tells the story of each part of these teamsit kept me glued  Pastore does a really good job I thinktelling this story  He uses his own obvious sailingsailboat expertise to recreate every detail of the enormous (at least for their day) vesselstheir crews  You get a sense for the danger involvedthe what was at stakeyou can trust the author  He is academic about the details but his love for boatssailing permeates  The races took place over a hundred years ago but he makes them excitingyou really don't know what's going to happen  It's fun  I have written reviews of fiction before but never for non-fiction  This book really grabbed my attention for some reason  I don't think I will be alone  The story works on so many levelspolitical nautical technological economic  I am giving this book for a christmas gift  I feel confident that several members of my family will enjoy this story
