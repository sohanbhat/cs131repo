0. Top find Top 10 who got the highest number of retweets, I used grep to filter for retweets and used cut on the 5th column 
which contains the referenced tweet id. Then, using awk and sed, I filtered for the id number itself and sorted the result.
Then, I cut the 1st and 2nd columns of the original file to find the authors of the retweets. Using grep -f, I filtered for
the entries containing the retweet ids found in the original file. Then, I found the counts of each retweet within the
retweet file and kept the author column. Since authors have several tweets, finding retweet counts for each of their
tweets was necessary. After counts were found, I joined the two files containing the counts for each tweet and the 
corresponding retweets received. Lastly, I used awk and an array to total up the total retweets received for each author. 
To print the top 10 authors, I sorted in reverse and used head to get the top 10 authors with highest retweets.

1. To create the graph between users that were retweeted and those who retweeted them, I used grep to filter for retweets and 
used cut on the 5th column which contains the referenced tweet id. Then, using awk and sed, I filtered for the id number itself
and sorted the result.Then, I cut the 1st and 2nd columns of the original file to find the authors of the retweets. Using grep -f, I filtered for
the entries containing the retweet ids in the original file. Then, I used cut on the 2nd and 5th column of the retweets file
to find the individual who retweeted each corresponding tweet. Then I joined the files, using these common tweets ids to join
the author and retweeter of the given tweet. Lastly, I used to cut on the output of the join to get the graph and remove 
the tweet id itself.

2. Using the retweet graph from number 1, I found the counts of retweets for each author and sorted the result. Then, I filtered
out the result to have authors who had three or more tweets and used uniq to find the counts of authors with "n" total tweets for
use in the histogram.

3. See retweets_histogram.png which is a histogram that shows the number of authors who received three
or more retweets.


4. To find the 30 most common hashtags, I began by using grep to filter for retweets and used cut on the 5th column
which contains the referenced tweet id. Then, using awk and sed, I filtered for the id number itself and sorted the result.
Now, I cut columns 1-4 in the original file for use with grep -f to filter for only retweets. Now, with the only_retweets_sorted.tsv
file, I cut the author and tweets column, which will be used to find the hashtags that were most commonly found with authors who received
three or more replies. Next, I used downloaded_tweets_extend_nolf2.tsv file to find the rewtweets ids and authors of those retweets. 
By joining these files, I could have the author of the retweet in one file. Then, using uniq, I filtered for authors with three or
more retweets and used this set of authors with grep-f to find the all the hashtags associated with the authors that have 3 or more
retweets. 

The hashtags that were different in retweets were fluke_natouch, dogs, demvoice1, ohmthitiwat, โอห์มไง, covidisnotover, ukrainerussiawar, onpoli, and yyc. 
There were 21 similarities.

6. I plotted three total plots: 
1. Directed Graph of Retweets to User 15801906.png which shows the retweets received for User# 15801906. 
Each node represents a different user who retweeted one of User 15801906 tweets.
2. Directed Graph of Replies to User 15801906.png which shows the replies received for User# 15801906.
Each node represents a different user who replied to User 15801906 tweets    
3. retweets_histogram.png which is a histogram that shows the number of authors who received three 
or more retweets.
