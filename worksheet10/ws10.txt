1. I ran the python script in numbers.py using the python3 command. 
]0;sohan@sjsu:/mnt/scratch/sohan[sohan@sjsu sohan]$ time python3 numbers.py
min 0 max 15835 avg 9.33467921636312

real	0m19.651s
user	0m18.880s
sys	0m0.770s

2. I ran the shell script that performs the same function of the python script, 
which is to calculate the minimum, maximum, and average of the 9th column of the amazon
reviews dataset containing helpful votes. 
]0;sohan@sjsu:/mnt/scratch/sohan[sohan@sjsu sohan]$ time . numbers.sh
min 0 max 15835 average 9.33468

real	0m20.274s
user	0m19.953s
sys	0m0.320s

3. The shell script ran marginally slower than the python program based on real / user times. However,
the sys metric of the shell script was half of the python program, which indicates it spent half as
much time in the kernel mode. Generally however, I believe shell scripts run faster than python scripts.
